FOTOMATIC PROJECT - Codecademy

This project requires fixing broken code from a website while making it responsive and styling it according to the [design spec](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/full-stack-career-journey/Fotomatic/final/index.html?_gl=1*78bjv*_ga*Mzg3NTU3MzU2LjE2OTI1ODE3Njk.*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY5Mjg0MDQ3MS4yLjEuMTY5Mjg0Mjk3NC41NS4wLjA.).

In HTML, I found and fixed the following:
1) The Head section was missing:
     - Title attribute
     - Link to the CSS styleshet
     - The view point meta tag for responsive design
2) The main body:
     - Some of the images had  a wrong relative path
     - Several mistypes, like commenting the Entire Quotes section instead of just the intended comment
     - Missing button class for desktop version
In CSS:
     - The Sign Up Section was missing Section 
     - Updating width, display, padding and pixel sizes to enable responsiveness
     - Missing a few class selectors like "nav .button" and adding appropriate properties like padding, background-          color, line-height and color
     - A few class selectors were missing the period to link them to the html
